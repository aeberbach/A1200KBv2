A few years ago I made my first Amiga 1200 mechanical keyboard. I did not know at the time about any other efforts that might be underway so I just went ahead and did it - it turned out well and a lot of people built them. Still there is always a temptation to try and improve something. I was never really happy about the mounting system and the 9U spacebar was a problem, even more so than finding the keycaps that match the Amiga key sizes, modern keyboards went in a different direction.

So here is version 2. At the time of the last keyboard, low-profile keyswitches existed but were hard to find and often could not use MX-stem caps, now it is easy. I'm typing this with a Nuphy Air75 v2 with "Gateron x Nuphy Moss" KS-33 switches and the feel is amazing. There is a lighter variant "Wisteria" and a regular brown tactile option. Blue (clicky) and several variants of linear including red are available too. These switches use a different footprint to standard MX so the PCB had to be redone.

Under the old keyboard a 10x3mm aluminium bar was used to stiffen the whole assembly, running from one side of the case to another sitting on 3d-printed mounts. I want to move that out of the way of expansions under the keyboard. I never noticed a problem with a TF1230 but with a larger accelerator having a heatsink it might be, so I'm moving the bar in the hope that one day I get a TF1260 or similar. This keyboard will sit higher in the case compare to the old one.

Also changed with this keyboard is the space bar layout. You can use whichever width space bar you can find, from the rare but Amiga-original 9U to the modern 6.25U. If you use something narrower than 9U then the remaining space can be filled by 3D-printed modules that are attached with M3 bolts.

If using a narrower space bar then the space-filling module can contain a translucent part to allow a LED to shine through to indicate caps lock. Three LED positions are provided to suit whatever you want to do. The conventional cap lock position under the caps lock key is also provided but a shine-though (windowed or translucent double shot) is very hard to find - in my first A1200 keyboard it just glowed under the opaque keycap, not ideal but it works.

To allow for a plate on top of the PCB various M3 holes are provided. The low profile switches do not come in a 5-pin PCB mount version so a plate is essential. While laser-cut would be amazing I don't have a laser cutter and will need to print something. It should be possible to print a plate in two or three pieces and this should keep the keyswitches perfectly straight, improve keyboard stiffness, dampen sound and make for a better appearance.

Requirements:
- one PCB (see the 'fab' folder for gerber files, ready to build)
- 96 Gateron KS-33 keyswitches
- 5 Gateron 2U plate-mount low-profile stabilizers
- 1 Gateron 6.25U plate-mount low-profile stabilizer (or other width to suit your space bar)
- one 0805 surface mount LED (caps lock)
- one FFC connector, 32-way RA 1.25mm pitch. Molex 52044-3245 (available Mouser Electronics)
- one FFC ribbon cable, 32-way, 1.25mm pitch. Molex 15168-0400 (available Mouser Electronics)
- Printed modules to fill space between space and keys to either side, if not using 9U space bar (STLs in Printable folder)
- Printed plate to house stabilizers and switches on top of PCB (STLs in Printable folder)
- Printed mounts to secure the keyboard in your case (STLs in Printable folder)
- various M3 bolts for assembly (refine this list when everything is designed)
 - 96 Amiga keycaps (Steveed - will you be selling these? Is there a way people can order from SP direct?)
 
The cost of all this varies with the cost of PCB manufacture, keyswitches and stabilizers and of course the keycaps. As a very rough guide expect to pay *no less* than about:
- PCB $20
- keyswitches $30
- stabilizers $20
- LED $0.50
- FFC connector and cable $8
- 3D printed parts $10

And assembly will take at least three hours. That's just under $100 in parts alone and does not even count a quality set of keycaps at around $150. Clearly if you want one of these you are a person of wealth and taste and know which is the best computer! If a person has ordered the minimum of 5 PCBs from one of the usual places and wants to offer the extras for sale, an assembled keyboard (no caps) should sell for no more than $150. That's a small but fair markup for labour and the person building five keyboards will end up paying for their own.

The STL folder is not yet present. It will eventually contain mounts for the A1200.net Amiga case, mounts for the original C= and Escom cases if people loan me those to measure, the plate for the top of the PCB and the spacer modules that fit to the side of the space bar.
