A few years ago I made the first Amiga 1200 mechanical keyboard. I did not know at the time about any other efforts that might be underway so I just went ahead and did it - it turned out well and a lot of people built them. Still there is always a temptation to try and improve something. I was never really happy about the mounting system and the 9U spacebar was a problem, even more so than finding the keycaps that match the Amiga key sizes, modern standard went in a different direction.

So here is version 2. At the time of the last keyboard low-profile keyswitches existed but were hard to find, now it is easy. I'm typing this with a Nuphy Air75 Versv2 with Wisteria low-profile Gateron switches and the feel is amazing. There is a heavier variant "Moss" and a regular brown tactile options. Blue (clicky) and several variants of linear including Red are available. These switches use a different footprint to standard MX so the PCB had to be redone.

Under the old keyboard a 10x3mm aluminium bar was used to stiffen the whole assembly. I want to move that out of the way of expansions under the keybaord. I never noticed a problem with a TF1230 but with a larger accelerator having a heatsink it might be, so I'm moving the bar out of the way in the hope that one day I get a TF1260 or similar.

Finally, why Amiga? I've done a lot with Aari 8-bit (400, 800, 800XL) systems lately, some Apple II also, and they are good but nothing quite hits all the buttons like the Amiga. The Apple II has a good 80-column mode but sluggish graphics, though it can show pretty static images. The Atari has no 80-column mode without expensive and very hard-to-find add-ons. I even bought a BBC Master and it too is a nice machine, but the keyboard needs fixing and the round keyswitches are not readily fixable. I haven''t explored it much yet but maybe that will be the next keyboard. The keycaps will fit a MX keyswitch if the stem is carefully shaved down top and bottom, a process which will take hours...
